    <p>At martinade, we are heavy readers and the reading list is increasing. It's becoming difficult to follow who is reading/owning what. We are looking for a fun solution to this problem.</p>
    <p>The following features are needed</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Users should be able to create a reading list (toread, reading, done).</li>
      <li>A book reference can be "own" by one or more users.</li>
      <li>Book references can have "tags" (like sf, romance, politology, philo, ...)</li>
      <li>Book references can be fetched from <a href="https://data.bnf.fr/">bnf api</a> or other websites</li>
    </ul>
